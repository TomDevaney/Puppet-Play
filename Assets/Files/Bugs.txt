Fixed: Move back trigger after multiple jumps so you're both on platforms

Fixed: Move first enemy trigger to the next house so you're closer to enemies

Fixed: Second respawn point is broken. Spawns me on house. Maybe have a second trigger that it spawns me to? This will fix first spawn making me fall

Fixed: After beating the game and playing through again, when daughter got ambushed, the dialogue broke? It played twice? Then it ended on the wrong dialogue at then end

Fixed: Make princess jumping platforms in 2nd cutscene smoother

Fixed: Look into footsteps. Enemy's is being used for players for some reason
	then change volume as well so they're subtle
	
Did idle instead: Add back enemy's footsteps

Fixed: PatrollingEnemy(1) still has footsteps remove that

Fixed: The spawned stationary enemies are the old model
	Yep: Maybe they should even be making the sounds too
	
Fixed: When the game is beat, and you're put back at the default checkpoint, it makes the sound again

Can pause the game when the curtains are opening
	Breaks the game 
	
When the game is played again, the dialogue after the dance is started immediately
