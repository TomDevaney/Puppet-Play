Fixed: Move back trigger after multiple jumps so you're both on platforms

Fixed: Move first enemy trigger to the next house so you're closer to enemies

Fixed: Second respawn point is broken. Spawns me on house. Maybe have a second trigger that it spawns me to? This will fix first spawn making me fall

Fixed: After beating the game and playing through again, when daughter got ambushed, the dialogue broke? It played twice? Then it ended on the wrong dialogue at then end

Fixed: Make princess jumping platforms in 2nd cutscene smoother

Fixed: Look into footsteps. Enemy's is being used for players for some reason
	then change volume as well so they're subtle
	
Did idle instead: Add back enemy's footsteps

Fixed: PatrollingEnemy(1) still has footsteps remove that

Fixed: The spawned stationary enemies are the old model
	Yep: Maybe they should even be making the sounds too
	
Fixed: When the game is beat, and you're put back at the default checkpoint, it makes the sound again

Fixed: Can pause the game when the curtains are opening
	Breaks the game 
	
Fixed: When the game is played again, the dialogue after the dance is started immediately

Fixed: Add trees to the last level piece

Fixed: Can die after killing enemy and the kill event still happens

Fixed: Enemy gets hit and then the player days in the same frame

I think it got fixed just by my other fixes: The princess attacking the enemies at the end is broken sometimes
	- I reproduced it by dying while attacking the enemies
		Maybe it's attached to dying?
		
Fixed: If you double click attack, you will attack twice
