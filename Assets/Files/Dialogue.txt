Dad
Hey, come check this out.

Daughter
Awesome! Let me try!

Dad
Hold up a sec. This one’s mine. You have your own.

Daughter
That’s not fair! How’d you do that?

Dad
Oh this?

Dad
Just practice.

Daughter
That is so not fair! I want to be able to do that!

Dad
Trust me. You’ll be able to soon. It just takes practice.

Daughter
Where are we anyway?

Knight
You would know if anyone. This is your land of course, your majesty.

Daughter
Wow. This is my kingdom?

Knight
Why, yes it is. You are the princess of course.

Princess
Why yes, I am the princess. But where’s my castle?

Knight
Here. I’ll take you to it. 

Princess
Ouchy! I bumped my head trying to get up there. How’d you get up there so easily?

Knight
It’s easy your majesty. It’s all in the legs. Try again.

Daughter
I did it!

Knight
That you did your majesty. It only gets harder from here though.

Princess
Sir knight! How am I supposed to get up there? It’s too high!

Knight
You have to jump on to these platforms to get up there. Watch and learn!

Knight
See? Easy!

Princess
That looks hard! I’m not sure my little princess body can handle that.

Knight
My lady, anything is possible. You are stronger than you think.

Princess
Alright. Let me try then...

Princess
Woohoo! I did it!

Knight
You see! What did I tell you?

Princess
I can’t believe we just did that!

Knight
I told you you would get the hang of things. And I’d say we’re half way to the castle your majesty.

Daughter
Daddy! What are those. They’re scary!

Knight
Oh no! Those look like the minions of the dastardly Count Duradel the fourth. They’ve invaded your kingdom your highness. 

Princess
Attack them before they can hurt anyone.

Princess
Yes! You saved the town!

Knight
Not so fast. If there’s some here, there’s probably even more. Stick close to me while we go deeper into the town.

Princess
Oh great. There's even more!

Knight
Tis not a problem. Just stay behind me as I deal with these monsters.

Princess
I can’t believe you took them all out by yourself.

Knight
It’s what I’ve trained for my whole life. 

Daughter
Help daddy! They’ve surrounded me!

Knight
You are the most powerful person in this whole land. These monsters should be afraid of you. You shouldn’t be afraid of them!

Daughter
But they’re going to hurt me! I don’t want to die!

Knight
How many times do I have to tell you your majesty. You are always stronger than you think. You saw me attack them earlier. Attack them just like you saw me do it earlier.

Princess
And that’s what you get for trying to attack the princess of the Kingdom of Fluffy Rabbit Ears!

Knight
Great job over there your majesty. Maybe Count Duradel will think twice before he sends his minions into your kingdom! And look the castle is right ahead.

Princess
The castle is so beautiful!

Knight
And it’s yours. This whole kingdom is yours.

Princess
What about the Count? He’s trying to take away my kingdom. We need to stop him before he harms anyone else in my kingdom.

Knight
We can’t do anything when we’re tired. We’ve had an exhausting day your highness. We will stop the count after we get some rest.
