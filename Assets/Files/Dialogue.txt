Dad
Hey sweetie. Come over here.

Daughter
Wow, what is this?

Dad
It's a puppet show. You see, check this out.

// End of dialogue

Daughter
Oh my gosh, he can dance! I want to try!

Daughter
Hmph. It's too hard. I can't make her dance.

Dad
That's okay. You just need to practice a bit. You'll get the hang of it.

Daughter
So where are we anyways?

Knight
You would know if anyone. This is your land of course, your majesty.

Daughter
Wow. This is my kingdom?

Knight
Why, yes it is. You are the princess of course.

Princess
Why yes, I am the princess. But where’s my castle?

Knight
Here. I’ll take you to it. 

// End of dialogue

Princess
I tried to jump, but it didn't do anything. How’d you get up there so easily?

Knight
It’s easy your majesty. It’s all in the legs. Try again.

// End of dialogue

Daughter
I did it!

Knight
That you did your majesty. It only gets harder from here though.

// End of dialogue

Princess
Sir knight! How am I supposed to get up there? It’s too high!

Knight
Weren't you paying attention? It's easy!

Princess
It looked hard! I’m not sure my little princess body can handle that.

Knight
My lady, anything is possible. You are stronger than you think.

Princess
Alright. Let me try then...

// End of dialogue

Princess
Woohoo! I did it!

Knight
You see! What did I tell you? You made that look easy!

Knight
If you can handle that, the rest of this stuff will be even easier!

// End of dialogue

Princess
That was super easy.

Knight
I knew you would get the hang of things quickly. And look. We've arrived at your town.

Princess
Wow. I can't believe I have a town.

Knight
I mean you are a princess. What else would you reside over? Ant hills?

// End of dialogue

Daughter
Daddy! What are those. They’re scary!

Knight
Oh no! Those look like the minions of the dastardly Count Duradel IV.

Princess
They’ve invaded my kingdom! 

Princess
This is unacceptable! Give them a spanking!

// End of dialogue

Princess
Yes! You saved the town!

Knight
Not so fast. If there’s some here, there’s probably even more. Stick close to me.

// End of dialogue

Princess
Oh great. More of the evil things.

Knight
See, I told you there'd be more. 

Knight
Tis not a problem. Just stay behind me as I deal with these monsters.

// End of dialogue

Princess
I can’t believe you took them all out by yourself.

Knight
I mean it'd be sad if I couldn't handle that.

Knight
It is what I have trained for my whole life. 

// End of dialogue

Daughter
Help daddy! They’ve surrounded me!

Knight
You are the most powerful person in this whole land.

Knight
These monsters should be afraid of you. You shouldn’t be afraid of them!

Daughter
But they’re going to hurt me! I don’t want to die!

Knight
How many times do I have to tell you your majesty. 

Knight
You are stronger than you think. 

Knight
Believe in yourself.

// End of dialogue

Princess
And that’s what you get for trying to attack the princess of the Kingdom of Fluffy Rabbit Ears!

Knight
Great job your majesty!

Knight
Maybe Count Duradel will think twice before he sends his minions into your kingdom! 

// End of dialogue

Knight
What do you think of the castle your majesty

Princess
It's so beautiful!

Knight
And it’s yours. This whole kingdom is yours.

Princess
What about the Count? He’s trying to take away my kingdom.

Princess
We need to stop him before he harms anyone else in my kingdom.

Knight
We can’t do anything when we’re tired. We’ve had an exhausting day your highness. 

Knight
We will stop the count after we get some rest.

Princess
Ok... I guess I am getting really sleepy...

Princess
But it's got to be the first thing we do tomorrow.

Knight
As you wish your highness.

Daughter
That was fun daddy.

Dad
I'm happy. Ya know I spent a lot of time working on all of that.

Daughter
When do you think we'll be able to play next?

Dad
Well, it might take a while actually because I haven't even started on the next part.

Daughter
Aw man! You better hurry up. I need to teach Count Duracell a lesson.

Dad
Yes, your majesty. I'll get right on it!
