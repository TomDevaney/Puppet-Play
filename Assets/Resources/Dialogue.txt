Dad
Hey sweetie. Come over here.

Daughter
Wow, what is this?

Dad
It's a puppet show. You see, check this out. 

Dad
I can make him do this.

// End of dialogue

Daughter
Oh my gosh, he can dance! I want to try!

Dad
Hold your horses. Maybe, you should learn to walk first before you try to dance.

Daughter
Yeah, I guess you have a point. 

Daughter
So where are we anyways?

Knight
You would know if anyone. This is your land of course, your majesty.

Daughter
Wow. This is my kingdom?

Knight
Why, yes it is. You are the princess of course.

Princess
Why yes, I am the princess. But where’s my castle?

Knight
Here. I’ll take you to it. 

// End of dialogue

Daughter
How do I get up there daddy? 

Knight
It’s easy your majesty. It’s all in the legs.

Daughter
I can't figure it out! This is hard!

Dad
Here, try it this way.

Daughter
Ok, I'll give it a shot.

// End of dialogue

Daughter
I did it!

Knight
That you did your majesty. It only gets harder from here though.

Knight
Just keep your calm, and you'll be able to handle the rest easily.

Knight
Let's keep on moving. We still have a ways to go.

// End of dialogue

Princess
Sir knight! How am I supposed to get up there? It’s too high!

Knight
Weren't you paying attention? It's easy!

Princess
It looked hard! I’m not sure my little princess body can handle that.

Knight
My lady, anything is possible. You are stronger than you think.

Princess
Alright. Let me try then...

// End of dialogue

Princess
Woohoo! I did it!

Knight
You see! What did I tell you? You made that look easy!

Knight
If you can handle that, the rest of this stuff will be even easier!

// End of dialogue

Princess
That was super easy.

Knight
I knew you would get the hang of things quickly. And look. We've arrived at your town.

Princess
Wow. I can't believe I have a town.

Knight
I mean you are a princess. What else would you reside over? Ant hills?

Princess
I'd hope not. That makes my skin crawl just thinking about those little things.

Princess
So how do we get into my kingdom? The gate is closed.

Knight
I mean you're the princess. Just tell it to open.

Princess
Oh, ok. But why was it closed in the first place?

Knight
To keep the bad things out of course.

Princess
That makes sense. Alright then, time to open the door. 

Princess
Open sesame!

// End of dialogue

Knight
Remember, this is your land. You control things around here.

Princess
Yeah, I guess it'll just take some getting used to.

// End of dialogue

Daughter
Daddy! What are those. They’re scary!

Knight
Oh no! Those look like the minions of the dastardly Count Duradel IV.

Princess
They’ve invaded my kingdom! I thought you said the gate would keep them out!

Knight
You're right... How is it even possible that they got in?

Princess
I don't know, but this is unacceptable! Give them a spanking!

// End of dialogue

Princess
Yes! You saved the town!

Knight
Not so fast. I think there's more ahead. Stick close to me.

Princess
Hold on, why's there a gate in front of us?

Knight
It's the town's defenses.

Knight
They must've went up to keep the minions from getting to the castle. 

Knight
They'll open when we have defeated the monsters.

// End of dialogue

Knight
See?

Princess
Ok. Let's go get the rest of them then!

// End of dialogue

Princess
Oh great. There's even more than before!

Knight
Tis not a problem. Just stay behind me as I deal with these monsters.

// End of dialogue

Princess
I can’t believe you took them all out by yourself.

Knight
I mean it'd be sad if I couldn't handle that.

Knight
It is what I have trained for my whole life. 

// End of dialogue

Daughter
Help daddy! They’ve surrounded me!

Knight
You are the most powerful person in this whole land.

Knight
These monsters should be afraid of you. You shouldn’t be afraid of them!

Daughter
But they’re going to hurt me! I don’t want to die!

Knight
How many times do I have to tell you your majesty. 

Knight
You are stronger than you think. 

Knight
Believe in yourself.

// End of dialogue

Daughter
I did it!

Princess
I think this calls for the royal dance!

// End of dialogue

Knight
Wow. Great fighting and dancing moves your highness. 

Knight
Now I see why it's called the royal dance.

Knight
When the peasants do that dance, it looks awful.

Knight
But when you do it, there's such an elegance to it!

Princess
Well, the people just need to be taught by their queen how to do the dance.

Princess
Anyone can do it. It's not just for royalty.

Knight
Not me. I'm getting too old to be learning any new dance moves.

Knight
But enough of that, let's get going. The castle should be right ahead.

// End of dialogue

Knight
What do you think of the castle your majesty

Princess
It's so beautiful!

Knight
And it’s yours. This whole kingdom is yours.

Princess
What about the Count? He’s trying to take away my kingdom.

Princess
We need to stop him before he harms anyone else in my kingdom.

Knight
We can’t do anything when we’re tired. We’ve had an exhausting day your highness. 

Knight
We will stop the count after we get some rest.

Knight
It's not like he'll attack again anytime soon.

Knight
I think you taught him that lesson when you defeated his minions.

Princess
Ok. I guess I am actually getting really sleepy...

Princess
But it's got to be the first thing we do tomorrow.

Knight
As you wish your highness.

Daughter
That was fun daddy.

Dad
I'm happy. I spent a lot of time working on all of that.

Daughter
When do you think we'll be able to play next?

Dad
Well, it might take a while actually because I haven't even started on the next part.

Daughter
Aw man! You better hurry up. I need to teach Count Duracell a lesson.

Dad
Yes, your majesty. I'll get right on it!
